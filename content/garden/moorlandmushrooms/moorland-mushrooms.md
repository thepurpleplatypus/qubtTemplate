The Yorkshire moors may not seem like a good habitat for mushroom hunting. You’re not going to find great swathes of popular edible fungi. Mostly it’s going to be LBMs (little brown mushrooms). But it can still be rewarding and sometimes surprising. I hadn’t expected to find Waxcaps half way up a mountain!
