Mottlegills are so called because their gills tend to have a patchy or mottled appearance. They are classic LBMs (little brown mushrooms) but one of the easier types to differentiate. That said, I’m not confident which of the Mottlegills this is. It was found in damp sheep pasture. Either the Banded or the Brown Mottlegill seem good candidates.
