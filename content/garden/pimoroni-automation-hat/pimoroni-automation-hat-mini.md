I've been dabbling with the [Automation Hat Mini](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/automation-hat-mini?variant=31478878077011) to build a battery monitor. I've paired this with a Raspberry PI Zero W I had stashed in a drawer. It hasn't gone entirely to plan...

Normally the [Pimoroni installer](https://learn.pimoroni.com/article/getting-started-with-automation-hat-and-phat) takes care of everything. This was the case with the Enviro board. But in this case I got a number of package errors straight away. First up the example code gave me errors with 'gpiod' and 'gpiodevice'.

This forum post was very helpful: [https://forums.pimoroni.com/t/issue-with-enviro-with-rpi-zero-display-and-particles-not-working/23365/15](https://forums.pimoroni.com/t/issue-with-enviro-with-rpi-zero-display-and-particles-not-working/23365/15)
